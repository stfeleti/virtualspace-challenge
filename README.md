# Virtual Challenge Solutions

This repository is dedicated to showcasing solutions for Virtual Challenge coding challenges. The solutions are organized into two main sub-solutions: \"Merge K Sorted Lists\" and \"Web Crawler Multithreaded.\"

## Merge K Sorted Lists

The \"Merge K Sorted Lists\" challenge involves merging multiple sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list, demonstrating efficient data structures and algorithm optimization.

### ConsoleAppMergeKList

**Description**: This console application implements the algorithm to merge K sorted linked lists. It serves as a practical demonstration of handling and processing linked data structures.

**Usage**:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `ConsoleAppMergeKList` directory.
3. Run `dotnet build` to compile the project.
4. Execute the compiled application with `dotnet run`.

**Technologies Used**: C#, .NET Core

### MergeKListsTest

**Description**: This project contains unit tests for the Merge K Sorted Lists algorithm, ensuring its correctness and efficiency.

**How to Run Tests**:
1. Navigate to the `MergeKListsTest` directory.
2. Run `dotnet test` to execute the test suite.

**Testing Framework Used**: NUnit

## Web Crawler Multithreaded

This solution demonstrates a multi-threaded web crawler, showcasing skills in concurrent programming, network data processing, and HTML content parsing.

### Web Crawler Multithreaded ConsoleApp

**Description**: A multi-threaded console application that crawls and processes web content. It efficiently fetches pages from the web and parses HTML to extract and follow links.

**Usage**:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Web Crawler Multithreaded ConsoleApp` directory.
3. Run `dotnet build` to compile the application.
4. Launch the application with `dotnet run`, optionally specifying a start URL.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-threaded web crawling
- Efficient URL queue management
- HTML content parsing using HtmlAgilityPack

## Installation

Clone the repository using:
``` git clone https://github.com/stfeleti/virtualspace-challenge.git ```
Navigate to the desired sub-solution directory as described in the usage instructions for each project.

## Requirements

- .NET Core 3.1 or later
- HtmlAgilityPack (for Web Crawler Multithreaded)
